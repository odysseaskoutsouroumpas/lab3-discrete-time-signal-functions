# Lab 3 â€“ Discrete-Time Signal Functions

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental discrete-time signal functions, along with corresponding plots for visualization and analysis. These functions form the basis for understanding digital signal processing (DSP).

## Contents

### Python Scripts:
- `monadiaia_wsi.py`: Implementation of the impulse signal Î´[n].
- `monadiaki_vimatiki_akolouthia.py`: Implementation of the step signal u[n].
- `imitonoidis_akolouthia.py`: Sinusoidal sequence sin(Ï‰n).
- `sinitonoeidis_akolouthia.py`: Cosine sequence cos(Ï‰n).
- `ekthetiki_akolouthia.py`: Exponential sequence (real and imaginary parts).
- `simata_python_vivliothiki.py`: A consolidated script that calls all the above functions.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

To run the scripts, make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `numpy` â€“ for numerical operations on signals.
- `matplotlib` â€“ for plotting and visualizing the signals.

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
